    "If we are using the `Trainer` API to train a model, the easiest way to upload the model to the Hub is to set `push_to_hub=True` when you define your `TrainingArguments`. Then, when you call trainer.train(), the Trainer will then upload your model to the Hub each time it is saved based on the `save_strategy=\"epoch\"` (here after every *epoch* it will be uploaded) in a repository in your namespace. By deafult, that repository will be named like the output directory you picked, but you can choose a different name with `hub_model_id=\"a_different_name\"`.<br />\n",
